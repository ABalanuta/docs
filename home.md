<h3>Note: Browser Compatibility</h3>

<p><b>Chrome Ubuntu 23.0.1271.97</b> - developed with, works great.</p>

<p><b>Chrome Windows 25.0.1364.172</b> - quick check revealed no browser specific bugs.</p>

<p><b>Firefox Ubuntu 15.0.1</b> - no critical browser specific bugs, but movement in the dashboard editor is much less smooth than chrome.</p>

<p><b>Internet explorer 9</b> - works well with compatibility mode turned off. F12 Development tools -> browser mode: IE9. Some widgets such as the hot water cylinder do load later than the dial.</p>

<p><b>IE 8, 7</b> - not recommended, widgets and dashboard editor <b>do not work</b> due to no html5 canvas fix implemented but visualisations do work as these have a fix applied.</p>

# RaspberryPI Gateway

This is a reliable solution which is simple to setup and works well if you just want to forward data to a remote emoncms server like emoncms.org.

It uses a read only file system approach as developed by Martin Harizanov which means its not susceptible to the SD Card failure issue from too many writes:

It uses Jerome Lafr√©choux's exellent python oem_gateway to forward the data to emoncms.org, or other remote server.

## 1) Download the ready-to-go SD card image:

Download pre-prepared image:

#### [oem_gateway24sep2013.img.zip](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B7G0lHyW4GQbNWFHRXhUdHg1bGs/edit?usp=sharing)

## Alternatively build it yourself:

## 2) Write the image to an SD card

### Linux

Start by inserting your SD card, your distribution should mount it automatically so the first step is to unmount the SD card and make a note of the SD card device name, to view mounted disks and partitions run:

    $ df -h

You should see something like this:

    Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/sda6             120G   90G   24G  79% /
    none                  490M  700K  490M   1% /dev
    none                  497M  1.7M  495M   1% /dev/shm
    none                  497M  260K  497M   1% /var/run
    none                  497M     0  497M   0% /var/lock
    /dev/sdb1             3.7G  4.0K  3.7G   1% /media/sandisk

Unmount the SD card, change sdb to match your SD card drive:

    $ umount /dev/sdb1 

If the card has more than one partition unmount that also: 

    $ umount /dev/sdb2

Locate the directory of your downloaded emoncms image in terminal and write it to an SD card using linux tool *dd*:

<div class='alert alert-error'><i class='icon-fire'></i> <b>Warning:</b> take care with running the following command that your pointing at the right drive! If you point at your computer drive you could lose your data!</div>

    $ sudo dd bs=4M if=raspberrypi_gateway.img of=/dev/sdb

### Windows 

The main raspberry pi sd card setup guide recommends Win32DiskImager, see steps for windows here:

### Mac OSX

## 3) Configure oemgateway settings in SD Card 59Mb boot partition

Open oemgateway.conf found in the SD Card boot partition:

![Boot partition](files/rpigatewayboot.png)

The first part to configure it the group and frequency of the rfm12pi.
The group and frequency set here needs to be the same as used on any sensor nodes.

For the frequency setting: 8 used as shorthand for 868Mhz and 4 for 433Mhz.

The second part to configure is the apikey of your remote server account, if its emoncms.org thats all you need to add here. If your posting to another server you will need to set the domain and you may need to set the path if the emoncms installation is in a sub-directory.

## 4) Plug in the RFM12Pi Expansion module

PLug the RFM12Pi hardware expansion module onto the Pi's GPIO pins taking care to align up pin 1.

Its best to plug in the RFM12Pi before you power up the Pi, as the Pi sends configuration settings to the RFM12Pi on bootup.

## 5) Power it up!

Thats it, if you have sensor nodes sending data, inputs should start appearing in your emoncms account.
